# Dockerized OpenMP environment ready for development
This is a dockerized development environment set up for use with VSCode and the remote containers extension which can be installed [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers).
Once you have installed the extension, open the the `src` folder with VSCode which is the folder in which your openMP source code will reside. 
hit `CTRL+SHIFT+P` to open the VSCode commands context menu, type `Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container` and either click or hit enter. A New window will pop up and you will be connected inside the docker container. The docker container has gcc and the openMP library already installed and is built to be lightweight. To compile openMP code, just use the terminal and type `make` which will utilize the pre-built makefile which compiles for this specific version of gcc and distribution. To delete the executable type `make clean`.
